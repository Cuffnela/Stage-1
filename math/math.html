      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I am interested in a broad range of mathematical topics. Luckily I have the chance
      to explore some of these topics with young math students over the summer each
      year at Governor's School. You can never know enough. There is so much information
      out there and a comparitively short amount of time to absorb it all. I never
      feel like I know enough about anything and continue to learn everyday. Here
      are some of the topics that are at the top of my list right now.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quantum Computing</li>
          <li>Modeling</li>
          <li>Differential Equations</li>
          <li>Numerical Approximation Methods</li>
          <li>Topology</li>

      <h2>Master's Thesis</h2>
      <p><em>A Comparison of Threshold Parameters in Deterministic SIS and SI11I2S Models and
      Stochastic SIS and SI1I2S Models.</em>(Under the direction of Dr. John Franke.)</p>
      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <p>Epidemic models are used to predict disease spread through a population.
         Accurate prediction of disease spread is important in the management of
         outbreaks and treatment of disease Deterministic <em>SIS</em> models carry
         with them the inherent assumption that the infection rate, &alpha;, and
         the recovery rate, &sigma;, are constant throughout the population and
         throughout time. In reality this assumption is flawed. There are many factors
         which can influence the rate at which infection spreads through out a population.
         Over the course of time environmental changes may cause variation in the
         rate of infection and ability of infected individuals to recover. To
        account for variation in infection rate and recovery rate over time we want to add stochasticity
        into our epidemic model. In this paper we outline a method to introduce stochasticity into an
        epidemic model where each parameter is drawn from some distribution and attempt to establish
        a threshold parameter for this model.</p>
      <p>Investigated the effect of stochastic parameters on the behavior of infectious disease
      models. Coded MATLAB programs to simulate an SIS model with parameters having
      various distributions and MATLAB programs using a binary search algorithm to
      find specific interval endpoints. Established a new threshold parameter utilizing the
      expected value for the stochastic SIS model resulting in a reliable prediction of long
      term model behavior.</p>
