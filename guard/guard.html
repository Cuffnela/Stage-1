      <h2>Middle Creek High School</h2>
      <p>I have worked with the marching band program at Middle Creek high school
      since fall of 2011. When I first began the guard had 11 members it has since
      grown to over twenty member for the coming 2016 marching band season. In 2015
      we launched a winter guard program. During the winter season I schedule all
      rehearsals and publish a weekly newsletter for parents. We have had immense
      success with our winter programs. During our inagural winter season the group
      was undefeated winning all four regular season competitons and taking home
      the gold in SRA2 at curcuit championships. As SRA2 curcuit champions the group
      was promoted up to SRA1 for the next year. In their second season the group was
      promoted midseason from SRA2 to A3. Undeafted in the regular season for thier
      second year the group placed fourth at championships in a close finish only 2
      points away from gold and less than a point from silver.
