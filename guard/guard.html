      <h2>Middle Creek High School</h2>
      <p>I have worked with the marching band program at Middle Creek high school
        as the color guard director since fall of 2011. When I first began the
        guard had 11 members it has since grown to over twenty member for the
        coming 2016 marching band season. In 2015 we launched a winter guard
        program. During the winter season I run the majority of the program.
        Scheduling rehersals, designing the show, and issuing weekly newsletter
        for parents and students. I am assited by Sydney Medlin during both the
        fall and winter season.We have had immense success with our winter
        programs. During our inagural winter season the group was undefeated
        winning all four regular season competitons and taking home
        the gold in SRA2 at curcuit championships. As SRA2 curcuit champions the group
        was promoted up to SRA1 for the next year. In their second season the group was
        promoted midseason from SRA2 to A3. Undeafted in the regular season for thier
        second year the group placed fourth at championships in a close finish only 2
        points away from gold and less than a point from silver.

      <h2>Heritage High School</h2>
      <p> I began working with Heritage as a guard technician in the fall of 2014.
        Since starting I have taken on additional guard drill design and show design
        rolls. I help the guard director flesh out ideas and create a cohesive and
        successful show. The guard program won its first championships during the
        2016 winter season with the show <em>Imagine</em>.
